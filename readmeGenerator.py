## Installation

To install or update this package, run:

```bash
pnpm add @reliverse/{package_name}@latest
```

or with Bun:

```bash
bun add @reliverse/{package_name}@latest
```

## How to Use This Library

To use `@reliverse/{package_name}`, ensure that your project is set up as an ES module by including `"type": "module"` in your `package.json` file. Since this package is structured as an ES module, you'll need to use `import` statements instead of `require`.

Here's an example of how to import and use a function from this package:

```ts
import {{ {function_name} }} from "@reliverse/{package_name}";

const someFile = "path/to/file";

export async function exampleFunction() {{
  await {function_name}(someFile);
}}
```

Please refer to the source files located in the [`src` folder](https://github.com/reliverse/{package_name}/blob/main/src) to learn about the currently implemented functions.

This package adopts the ES module format, with files compiled to `dist/.js`. This aligns with the Node.js team's recent recommendations, encouraging the JavaScript/TypeScript community to transition to the ES module standard. If your project still requires CommonJS (CJS) support, you may fork this repository and modify the build process to generate `dist/.cjs` files.
